# swierkosz.dev

[swierkosz.dev](https://swierkosz.dev) is my personal website and this is its source code.

The website is extremely bare-bones, but I want to get something more prominent up hopefully within
the next few months. For now, I have focused on truly learning and understanding webpack and
building a better configuration with up-to-date Webpack 5 features. I also want to use typescript
for this website.

FYI [web.dev](https://web.dev/) is a great source of knowledge.
