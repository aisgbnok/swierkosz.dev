              I want to have a full writeup on this sometime and even post it on GitHub, but I
              haven‚Äôt spent the time ensuring no private info/keys are in the private repo.

              This was cool, and I miss having the free time to do this stuff, I‚Äôm trying to get
              back into the swing of personal projects because it‚Äôs so fun and helps ground me.
              Anyway...

              This is a full-fledged website offering everything from account creation to submitting
              your order (not handling payments) .

              I learned how to use webpack, npm, and node for this. Everything relating to
              infrastructure was firebase. I wrote a custom sign-in process using firebase
              authentication. I used firebase cloud functions for creating user profiles/buckets in
              firestore, handling sending out emails to users, securely deleting user data, and
              getting random images for the homepage.
            </div>
            <div class="mdc-card__supporting-text">
              Something super cool was I wrote all this custom javascript for dynamically loading
              things. I had a hidden dialog box on every page. In firestore I could change anything
              and make it popup whenever I needed (like rolling out a new feature, or notifying
              users about something.)

              Similarly, on the store page every apparel item was a document in firestore in a
              collection of items. I could add or change any apparel item because their info was
              loaded and cached in firestore. So no having to compile a new build in webpack and
              upload it. If the band director needed something changed I could do it right from my
              phone! Man I loved working on this.

              I am working on this website in between my courses. It is pretty "bare-bones" as
              mentioned. I just needed to put something up on this domain. Something is
              better than nothing, I hope?

              Eventually, I want to load a lot of this content dynamically, and add some cool
              features like:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I have already started setting up dynamic links at <a

                </li>
                <li>
                  Move my old websites/projects under this domain as subdomains.

                <li>
                  Some of my courses use online VMs (no file transfer üòñ abilities). Some students
                  email themselves files, I use public Google Drive folders. It's a headache ü§Ø. I
                  want to add a simple file transfer service to this website. This will be used for
                  transferring small files like scripts. Only specific users authenticated through
                  firebase can use.

              I have a lot more projects that I have completed and that I'm working on right now. I
